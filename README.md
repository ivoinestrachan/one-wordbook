# One Word

A minimalist speed-reading iOS app that helps you consume multiple books efficiently by displaying one word at a time.

## Inspiration

This app was inspired by the video below, which explores how our brains process information and how we can optimize our reading experience:

## The Science Behind It

### How Traditional Reading Slows You Down

When you read normally, your eyes make small jumps (saccades) from word to word and line to line. These movements take up significant time and can cause:

- **Eye strain** from constant physical movement
- **Regression** - re-reading words you've already seen
- **Subvocalization** - mentally "speaking" each word, limiting speed to talking pace (~200 WPM)

### How One Word Works with Your Brain

This app uses **RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation)** technology, which aligns with how your brain naturally processes information:

1. **Eliminates Eye Movement**: Words come to you, not the other way around. Your eyes stay fixed on one spot, reducing fatigue and increasing focus.

2. **Forces Forward Momentum**: By controlling the pace, the app prevents regression and keeps you moving through content consistently.

3. **Breaks Subvocalization**: At speeds above 300 WPM, you can't mentally speak each word anymore - forcing your brain to process meaning directly and more efficiently.

4. **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Your brain only focuses on comprehension, not navigation. No decisions about where to look next or how fast to go.
